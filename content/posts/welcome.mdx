**Hello!**

After a brief couple of days work in collaboration with ChatGPT and my brain, my blog / site is here.

I'm admittedly pretty proud of it, given how rusty my development skills are. I was heavily inspired by [cobalt tools](https://cobalt.tools) changelog format, plus wanted a simple way to almost **journal** my entries and progress through various projects. Maybe in the future, I will be able to write entire project logs or DIY instructions for some of the things I've been working on.

### The "Stack"
Built with Next.js, styled with Tailwind, posts in MDX, using shadcn/ui components. The code is messy, but it works, and that really is all that matters to me right now. 

In the future, maybe I'll add a way to subscribe to a mailing list where you can get notified of new posts, or link some sort of discord / chat, etc. where people might be able to ask questions (if anyone ever reads this) about the projects here.

### When will I post next?
Well, I'm not quite sure when my next post will be, but I'm sure it'll be about PCB design for a project I've been working on called NODE (Network On-Demand Equipment).

> NODE is a rugged, portable internet system built around the Starlink Mini. Designed for remote access, vanlife, off-grid fieldwork, or emergency comms, NODE combines Starlink with internal battery power and weather-sealed ports.

You can read about it more on [GitHub](https://github.com/justinlevinedotme/node)

It's pretty fun, and although it's been done before, I am trying to create a version that everyone could build, because items like [Star-batt](https://star-batt.com/) are really expensive. I am not very experience in writing documentation or tutorials, so maybe this will help.

**Until Next Time!**
Justin
